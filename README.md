# cse210-PandorasBoxGame
Pandoraâ€™s box has been opened! It is up to you to fix what you broke in the first 
place and save the world that you put in jeopardy! Shoot your arrows at plagues, 
monsters, emotional stresses like raisin cookies that you thought were chocolate 
chip cookies, homework, and other life-threatening items as they hurtle at your 
face. Eliminate these from existence and return the world to its state of progress-less 
blissful ignorance where nothing good nor bad ever happens. 

## Getting Started
---
Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer and asciimatics 1.12.0 or new installed 
and running on your machine. You can install Asciimatics by opening a terminal 
and running the following command.
```
python3 -m pip install asciimatics
```
After you've installed the required libraries, open a terminal and browse to the 
project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.
```
python3 batter 
```
You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE 
and open the project folder. Select the main module inside the hunter folder and 
click the "run" icon.
